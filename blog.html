            <h3>About the owner and her philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                Over years of working for others, what struck me was either mediocre eyewear, outdated testing equipment
                in the back room, or both. ABC Opticals brings together the world’s finest
                and funkiest eyewear designers, coupled with state of the art equipment to make the eye examination a
                very civilised affair.

                We enjoy selling quality products, and most importantly, we enjoy finding the right frame for the right
                person. That's what we do and we do it well. We don't sell eyewear over the net, so visit us in person.
                We're worth the effort and your eyes should be too. Finally, we believe that children should be treated
                as special people so all our staff will make the experience at ABC Opticals the best we can for your
                child.

                Hi, my name is Amanda B Cormer and I'm the owner of ABC Opticals, and I'd like to briefly introduce you
                to who we are. I'm an optometrist with 20 years’ experience, having worked for independents and chain
                stores both here and in London. It was in London that I gravitated to the groovy, high end of the market
                and returned to Brisbane 9 years ago with a new concept.</p>
